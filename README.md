This project is for a FE 101 Boot Camp. As a novice who has recently started learning about Front-End development, I am still gaining experience with this topic. 
I have come to realize how complex it can be to create even a simple webpage. As a result, this project is subject to revision as I continue to learn and improve. 

To Sir Aldrin,
I am very grateful for the knowledge youâ€™ve shared, not just about front-end development, but also for the many insights and lessons that we will definitely use as we continue our journey in this field. 
We see you as an inspiration and motivation to move forward in our field. 
Thank you and God bless, Sir!

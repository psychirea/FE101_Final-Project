                <h1>Entry #1</h1>
                <p>When I was in high school, I didn't know what career path I wanted to pursue. I wasn't sure what I like and 
                    what's my interests. Not until pandemic came, everything changed in an instant. The learning mode became online 
                    or blended learning modality. It was really hard to adjust what they wanted us to do. But that time, I've 
                    developed my technical skills because I don't have any choice. From dreaming to be an architect to a stressed 
                    computer science student as of now. Just kidding. But anyways, I am currently upskilling, where I'm identifying 
                    what specific career would I choose in our broad field.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <ul>

                <br>
                <h1>Entry #2</h1>
                <p>2. When I first studied programming and had some ideas how coding could be difficult as it is, I unconsciously 
                    developed my interest in SQL. Java or C# isn't my forte, and SQL seems the easiest I've got. I don't know if 
                    it's just its nature, but yeah I was really enjoying learning about it. Even though I'm not yet knowledgeable 
                    enough, I definitely need to understand from its fundamentals to make it my expertise. I want to understand it 
                    better, and deeply. So, here I am, training myself even from the start.</p>

                <h1>Entry #3</h1>
                <p>3. During my senior high school days, there's this commercial that caught my attention. It wasn't just a 
                    simple advertisement but a calling for me to continue what I've chosen as my career. It was all about 
                    technology, engineering, and science. From a company that had been prioritizing the broad field of 
                    engineering and technology. The feeling I had every time I'm watching it was really different, I said 
                    to myself that I'll work somewhere like that. And that's what I want. I want to feel something someday.</p>
